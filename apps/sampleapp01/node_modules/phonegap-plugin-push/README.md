# Warning

The links below take you to the version 2.x documentation which includes a number of breaking API changes from version 1.x, mostly the move from GCM to FCM. If you are using version 1.x please reference the docs in the [v1.x branch](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-plugin-push/tree/v1.x).

# What is this?

This plugin offers support to receive and handle native push notifications with a **single unified API**.

Starting with version `2.0.0`, this plugin will support `CocoaPods` installation of the `Firebase Cloud Messaging` library. More details are available in the [Installation](docs/INSTALLATION.md#cocoapods) documentation.
